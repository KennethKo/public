/*
  minimal bindings for default windows-ish modifier key behavior

  This mapping presumes that you've gone into 
    System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys...
  And remapped Control (^) Key to Command, and Command (âŒ˜) Key to Control.

  To use this mapping, save this file as:
    ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict

  (You may have to create a folder in Library called "KeyBindings")

  Once the file is there, you may need to restart your application (browser, mail client) to have it respect these new keymappings
